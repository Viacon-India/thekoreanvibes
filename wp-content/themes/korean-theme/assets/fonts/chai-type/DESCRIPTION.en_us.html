  Chai is a variable display sans-serif font family that supports Latin and Devanagari.
  It is designed for titles, statements, headlines, annoucements, intros, outros, and other display texts.
  Although display type font families are traditionally more formal and stiff in their approach,
  Chai adds faint curves and subtle bluntness to the characters to add a <i>human informality</i> to its design.

  Chai is also the first OpenType Variable Font on Google Fonts to support Devanagari. It offers
  every single style on the weight (<code>wght</code>) axis between the range 300 to 700.
  Not only does this enable a wide array of display possibilities but also provides performance efficiency
  by providing the all the weight variations through a single font file.
